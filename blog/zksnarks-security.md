A comprehensive overview of common vulnerabilities and root causes in ZK-SNARK circuit implementations.

## Vulnerabilities

### V1. Under-Constrained
The most frequent vulnerability in ZK circuits arises from insufficient constraints. This deficiency causes the verifier to mistakenly accept invalid proofs, thus undermining the system's soundness or completeness.

### V2. Over-Constrained
Although less common than under-constrained issues, circuits can be over-constrained, leading to the rejection of valid witnesses by honest provers or benign proofs from honest verifiers. This issue stems from extra constraints in the circuit, where legitimate solutions cannot be proven or verified, leading to DoS issues. Nevertheless, over-constrained bugs should not be confused with redundant constraints that add no additional value but do not lead to any issues other than introducing computational inefficiencies.

### V3. Computational/Hints Error
Occurs when the computational part of a circuit is erroneous, often leading to completeness issues where for correct inputs, the witness generation either fails or produces wrong results. Note that completeness issues can often be transient, meaning that you can fix the underlying issue without having to update the circuit and re-compute the prover and/or the verifier keys. Computational issues may also result in soundness issues if the constraints are applied using the same erroneous logic.

## Root Causes

### R1. Assigned but not Constrained
A frequent issue in ZK circuit design lies in distinguishing between assignments and constraints. While constraints are mathematical equations that must be satisfied for any given witness for the proof to be valid, assignments allocate values to variables during the witness generation process. The problem arises when variables are assigned values based on correct computations but lack corresponding constraints. This oversight can lead the verifier to erroneously accept any value for these variables.

### R2. Missing Input Constraints
Developers sometimes neglect to apply constraints on input variables in reusable circuits. This omission occurs either (i) unintentionally or (ii) because they anticipate these constraints will be enforced at a different interface level (i.e., caller circuit or integration layer), thus omitting the constraints for optimization reasons. However, the absence of clear documentation or fully constrained inputs in these circuits can lead to severe vulnerabilities. Note that this issue is particularly common in low-level circuit DSLs, such as Circom, which lack user-defined types.

### R3. Unsafe Reuse of Circuit
In ZK circuit design, particularly when using DSLs like Circom, the practice of reusing circuits (such as templates in Circom or gadgets in halo2) can introduce vulnerabilities if not handled correctly. This primarily occurs in two scenarios:

- **(i) Implicit Constraints in Sub-Circuits:** Occurred when circuits are reused without appropriately constraining their inputs or outputs based on the assumption that the user will apply these constraints on call-site.
- **(ii) Insecure Circuits Instantiation:** When circuits are meant to be used for specific setups (e.g., specific curves). An example is the Sign template from circomlib, which was designed solely for the BN254 curve field.

### R4. Wrong Translation of Logic into Constraints
Translating computations for ZK circuits presents a unique set of challenges, primarily due to the distinct programming model of ZK circuits compared to traditional CPU-targeted code. A significant issue arises when translating logic that involves types and operations available in conventional programming languages but are either absent or must be re-implemented in ZK frameworks (e.g., fixed-point arithmetic). This often leads to the need for creative but error-prone solutions, such as using multiplexers for conditional logic. Developers might inadvertently omit essential constraints or simplify the logic to reduce the number of constraints, potentially missing critical corner cases. This can leave variables under-constrained, allowing them to accept multiple or any values under certain conditions, thus deviating from the developer's intent and introducing vulnerabilities.

### R5. Incorrect Custom Gates
In implementations following the TurboPLONK model, such as Halo2, circuit constraints are defined by using custom gates applied to specific rows and cells of a table that constitute the Plonkish representation of the circuit. However, this approach can lead to bugs when custom gates are incorrectly handled. Errors may arise from inaccurately determining the appropriate offsets, resulting in misalignment with the intended behavior of the circuit.

### R6. Out-of-Circuit Computation Not Being Constrained
Out-of-circuit computation refers to computations within the code that do not directly impact the witness generation yet play a crucial role in the overall functionality. In DSLs like Circom, certain functions operate outside the circuit logic. Similarly, in eDSLs, standard code (e.g., vanilla Rust) is used for various computations that do not affect witness generation. For instance, computations like division, are typically performed out-of-circuit to optimize circuit efficiency. This method involves executing the computation externally and then witnessing the result back into the circuit where it is constrained to ensure correctness. Issues arise when these out-of-circuit computations lead to missing assignments or when constraints necessary for the circuit's integrity are overlooked. A specific manifestation of this issue is the boomerang issue, where a variable, initially constrained within the circuit, is temporarily moved out-of-circuit and then reintegrated without the necessary reapplication of constraints.

### R7. Arithmetic Field Error
Working with field arithmetic in ZK circuits can be challenging, especially as developers might overlook the nuances of computations within a finite field. The most common issues in this context are arithmetic overflows and underflows. We categorize the primary types of overflows and underflows in ZK circuits as follows:

- **(i) Native Field Arithmetic Over/Underflow:** Occurs when circuit computations exceed the finite field's limits, causing values to loop back within the field's range due to modulo arithmetic.
- **(ii) Overflows in Transformed Formats:** Risks of overflows arise when numbers are transformed into bit representations for specific operations (e.g., range checks) or for emulating non-native arithmetics like fixed-point arithmetics. This is particularly problematic when multiple bit representations remain within the field's overflow limits, leading to under-constrained vulnerabilities.

### R8. Bad Circuit/Protocol Design
Circuit design issues in SNARKs often stem from fundamental flaws in how circuits are conceptualized, potentially leading to unintended behaviors or the violation of protocol properties. A common manifestation of this problem is the incorrect categorization of variables – such as designating a variable as private when it should be public. These issues can significantly impact the functionality and security of the protocol.

### R9. Other Programming Errors
This category encompasses a range of common programming errors that do not fit neatly into other specific vulnerability categories but still have significant implications for the integrity of SNARK systems. These errors include, but are not limited to, API misuse, incorrect indexing in arrays, and logical errors within the computational parts (i.e., witness generation) of the circuit that are not directly related to constraint application.
